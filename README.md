## Acknowledgments

Huge thanks to [Windsdon](https://github.com/Windsdon) and the incredible MAL API that he made it. All the support that [Lubien](https://github.com/lubien) gave in Github and talking to me at Telegram, helped me solved a lot of trouble that I was having. And the folks behind Telegraf for an awsome and well documented API. Without these kinda of people and their works it would be harder to make this bot.
